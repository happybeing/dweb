# dweb
A cross platform app and Rust library to view or publish websites on the decentralised web of the Autonomi peer-to-peer network.

This project contains **dweb** (a command line application) and **dweb-lib** (a Rust library). See the dweb README for detail of the features and capabilities available.

- **[dweb](https://github.com/happybeing/dweb/dweb-cli/README.md)** is a command line app for viewing decentralised websites using a standard browser, and for easily publishing your own websites to the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) pee-to-peer network. Can act as a local web server/service with built in web apps for file management, and RESTful access the Autonomi API over HTTP for other local web or desktop apps. Support is planned for backup and sync using [rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/).

- **[dweb-lib](https://github.com/happybeing/dweb/dweb-cli/README.md)** is a Rust library for including decentralised web capabilities in other applications.

## Status
This project is a work-in-progress that will move relatively quickly to begin with because the core functionality already exists in a demonstration which you can try out now:

- **awe** is a demo of both publishing, viewing websites an files on Autonomi which runs on Linux and Mac ([visit the awe repo](https://github.com/happybeing/awe)).

**awe** has been used to publish and view static HTML websites on Autonomi, using standard web tooling. Even WordPress like blogs can be published as demostrated using Publii ([visit getpublii.com](https://getpublii.com/)).
