# dweb
**dweb** is a Rust library which supports publishing and viewing websites on the decentralised web of the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) peer-to-peer network. With it you build apps which publish and view of decentralised websites and use helpers which simplify some areas of the Autonomi API.

- Capabilities and roadmap: see the features section of the **dweb-cli** [README.md](https://github.com/happybeing/dweb/tree/main/dweb-cli/README.md#Features).

- dweb API: see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/dweb/latest/dweb/).

- Add dweb to your Rust project:

  ```
    cargo add dweb
  ```

### Status
The dweb library is a work in progress so expect breaking changes expecially in newly added features. The web publishing format and command line interface are more stable but breaking changes are still possible.
