# dweb
**dweb** is a Rust library which supports publishing and viewing websites on the decentralised web of the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) peer-to-peer network. With it you build apps which publish and view of decentralised websites and use helpers which simplify some areas of the Autonomi API.

The capabilities available in **dweb** are described in the features section of the **dweb-cli** [README.md](https://github.com/happybeing/dweb/tree/main/dweb-cli/README.md#Features).

**WIP DO NOT USE YET:** this library is a work in progress published primarily for comment. It is fully implemented and working as described in a local build, but due it's reliance on patches needed to the Autonomi APIs it is not useful for other projects at this point. Also, there are changes planned by Autonomi to their API which will require corresponding changes to dweb, so again this is not useable until this has happened.

## Usage
Add dweb to your Rust project as normal with:

`cargo add dweb`
